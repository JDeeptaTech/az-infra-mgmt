 Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Terraform, Trunk-Based Development with Git Tags (effectively, GitHub Flow for releases) 

 hy Trunk-Based Development (with GitHub Flow for Releases) is Better for Terraform:
Minimizes State File Conflicts:

Terraform's unique challenge: Terraform relies heavily on a state file to map real-world infrastructure to your configuration. When multiple long-lived branches (like develop and main in GitFlow) are making changes to the same infrastructure, their state files inevitably diverge.
TBD Advantage: With TBD, all changes are integrated into main very frequently. This means the state file associated with main is always the most up-to-date representation of your infrastructure. This dramatically reduces the chances of complex, hard-to-resolve state conflicts that can occur when merging long-lived, divergent branches.
GitFlow Disadvantage: In GitFlow, if you modify the same resource on a develop branch and a main hotfix branch, merging them back can lead to painful state conflicts or even unintended resource recreation/deletion.
Faster Feedback Loops and Continuous Integration:

TBD Advantage: Small, frequent merges to main mean that changes are integrated and tested quickly. If an issue arises, it's identified and fixed much faster because the change set is small. This aligns perfectly with the CI/CD principles essential for IaC.
GitFlow Disadvantage: Long-lived feature or develop branches mean changes accumulate. When finally merged, the impact is larger, and isolating the root cause of an issue becomes harder and takes longer.
Simpler Branching Model:

TBD Advantage: Only main (the trunk) and short-lived feature branches. This is conceptually much simpler for teams to understand and manage.
GitFlow Disadvantage: Multiple long-lived branches (main, develop, release, hotfix) add significant overhead, complexity, and mental load. Developers constantly have to consider which branch to base their work on and where to merge.
Continuous Delivery Focus:

TBD Advantage: Naturally lends itself to continuous delivery. Every merge to main can potentially trigger a deployment to lower environments (like staging), and tagged commits on main lead to production releases. This speeds up your infrastructure delivery.
GitFlow Disadvantage: Its emphasis on distinct release branches and a more structured, often time-boxed, release cycle can slow down delivery.
Environment Promotion Clarity:

TBD Advantage: With a main branch that's always deployable, promoting changes from staging to production is often about applying the same main codebase to a different environment, potentially with a manual gate for production. Git tags make it easy to pinpoint exactly which version is deployed where.
GitFlow Disadvantage: GitFlow's merge-based promotion (e.g., develop to release to main) can be problematic for IaC, as the code might be merged, but the state of the infrastructure in different environments doesn't always align perfectly with the branch merges.
When might GitFlow seem appealing (and why it's usually not the best for Terraform):
Strict Release Schedules: If your organization has very rigid, scheduled release cycles for software, GitFlow's dedicated release branches might appear to offer better control for "hardening" a release.
TBD Counterpoint: While GitFlow can manage scheduled releases, TBD with clear tagging and manual gates on main for production deployments achieves similar control with far less complexity and state management headaches for Terraform. You're still controlling when a specific commit/tag on main goes to prod.
Large, Infrequent Releases: If you're dealing with very large, infrequent releases that require a long stabilization period.
TBD Counterpoint: This usually points to a need to break down changes into smaller increments, which TBD encourages. For IaC, large, infrequent releases are a recipe for painful deployments and state drift.
Conclusion:
For modern Terraform development, aiming for Trunk-Based Development with Git Tags (i.e., GitHub Flow for releases) is almost always the better option.

It reduces merge conflicts.
It simplifies your Git workflow.
It fosters continuous integration and faster delivery.
It's inherently more compatible with Terraform's state management.
The Jenkins Pipeline we've designed in the previous step perfectly embodies this TBD/GitHub Flow approach, providing automated testing on PRs, continuous deployment to lower environments from main merges, and a controlled, tag-based release process for production
