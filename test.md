Analysis
It looks like you're working on a pipeline for EV-Patching-Automation and need a user guide for your operations team, along with a check for shared path existence. That's a great goal!

Here's an overview of how we can approach this:

User Guide for Running the Pipeline: We'll break down the steps for your operations team to run the pipeline, explaining each input field they see in the image you provided.
Checking for Shared Path Existence: We'll discuss how you might incorporate a check for a shared path within your automation or as a prerequisite step.
Let's start by creating the user guide.

User Guide: Running the EV-Patching-Automation Pipeline
This guide will walk the operations team through the steps to execute the EV-Patching-Automation pipeline.

Purpose: This pipeline is designed to automate the patching process for Enterprise Vault environments.

Prerequisites:

Access to the pipeline execution environment (e.g., Jenkins, Azure DevOps, GitLab CI, etc., depending on what you're using).
Necessary permissions to trigger and monitor the pipeline.
Steps to Run the Pipeline:

Navigate to the Pipeline:

Log in to the pipeline execution platform.
Navigate to the EV-Patching-Automation pipeline, specifically the 1.Patching > #107 > Rebuild job.
Fill in the Parameters:

ev_environment

Description: Select the target Enterprise Vault environment for patching. This determines which set of EV servers will be affected.
Action: Click on the dropdown menu and select the appropriate environment (e.g., lab, dev, uat, prod).
Example from image: lab
ev_region

Description: Specify the geographical region where the Enterprise Vault environment resides. This ensures that patching is applied to servers in the correct region.
Action: Enter the region code.
Example from image: GB (for Great Britain)
run_db_upgrade

Description: This checkbox controls whether a database upgrade for Enterprise Vault hosts is performed as part of the patching process. Only check this if a database schema upgrade is required for the new package version.
Action: Check the box if a database upgrade is needed; otherwise, leave it unchecked.
Example from image: Unchecked.
ev_packageVersion

Description: Select the specific Enterprise Vault package version you wish to install. This is crucial for applying the correct patch.
Action: Click on the dropdown menu and select the exact package version.
Example from image: 15.1.0.0
changeRequest

Description: Enter the associated Change Request (CR) or Incident Number (INC) for this patching activity. This is vital for audit trails and tracking.
Action: Type in the Change Request or Incident number (e.g., CHG1234567 or INC1234567).
Initiate the Build:

Once all parameters are correctly filled, click the Rebuild button at the bottom of the page.
The pipeline will start executing, and you can monitor its progress from the build console/logs.
Checking for Shared Path Existence
Regarding the shared path existence, this is typically handled in one of two ways:

As a Pre-check within the Pipeline: The pipeline itself should have a step at the beginning to verify the existence and accessibility of any required shared network paths (e.g., for patch files, logs, etc.). If the path doesn't exist or isn't accessible, the pipeline should fail early with a clear error message.
As an Operational Prerequisite: The operations team might be responsible for ensuring the path exists and is accessible before running the pipeline. This is less ideal for automation but might be necessary in some environments.
